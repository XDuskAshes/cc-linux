# CC-Linux

A to-be Linux-esque kernel for OS basis.

# **This project is discontinued for now.**

### THIS IS A HEAVY WIP!

This is a WIP and I welcome forks and pull requests to change and improve the code.

### On contributions

I would like to establish a few rules for when you contribute to code.

1. If it needs explaining, explain away and sign your name with a date (time optional)
2. If you want you can sign your name where you coded stuff. Leave easter eggs!
3. If you see something that can be improved, improve it! (at least I) want this to be a functional thing, and functionality needs improvement. Just make sure to explain how it changes it, for the average joe who gets bored and looks at source code.
4. Talk about stuff on either making discussions in github or talk elsewhere, discords etc. If for some farfetched reason a discord is made for CC-Linux development and is active, I'll be damn impressed. (I don't think it'll ever happen)
5. Have fun with it, just help coagulate it and make it work.

### Any doubts?

I get it, I posted this in a discord and got some criticism but I am taking it and running. Specifically following these paraphrased points from [here](https://gist.github.com/MCJack123/4b2bca21bdc0cf5c67ce7177326c2154).

- Make sh*t easier on developers, that's the entire community, abstract stuff
- Don't try to make it necessarily trendy or cool
- Take inspiration (not code) from other successful CC OSes
- Keep in mind that you cannot make a true OS, but that doesn't mean that CC OSes are necessarily useless

### "The folders look like a close copy of linux filesy-"

I know probably a few people will say this but **thats the point.** It's supposed to be basically Linux in CC, therefore I make the filesystem *like* Linux.
